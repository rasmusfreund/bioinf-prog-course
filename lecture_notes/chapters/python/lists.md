# Lists of things

*This chapter is about lists and dictionaries that are Python values that can contain other Python values. Lists and dictionaries lets you build relationships between values, which is what data structures represent.*

## Lists {-}

For many kinds of data, the order of things is important. Just like the order of characters is important for the meaning of text in a string, we sometimes we want to specify the order of other things because the relative order of items in the list has some meaning. It could be a grocery list where you have listed the things to buy in the order you get to them in the supermarket. This is where Python lists are useful. When you print a list it nicely shows all the values it contains.

```python
grocery_list = ["salad", "canned beans", "milk", 'beer', 'candy']
print(grocery_list)
```

Unlike strings that can only store the order of characters, lists can contain *any* kind of values and you can mix different types of values any way you like. Here is a list that contains an integer, a boolean, a string and a list:

```python
mixed_list = [42, True, 'programming', [1, 2, 3] ]
```

By now you have probably guessed that you make a list with two square brackets. Between them you can put values with commas in-between. A list is a *container* of other values and the value of the list itself does not depend on the values it contains. This makes sense. Otherwise, an empty list would not have a value:

```python
my_list = []
```

You can add single values to the end of a list using the `append` method of lists. Try it out:

```python
desserts = []
print(desserts)
desserts.append('Crepe suzette')
print(desserts)
desserts.append('Tiramisu')
print(desserts)
desserts.append('Creme brulee')
print(desserts)
```

If you have a list you want to add to the end of another list you use the `extend` method:

```python
cheeses = ['Gorgonzola', 'Emmentaler', 'Camembert']
desserts.extend(cheeses)
print(desserts)
```

Notice how `append` and `extend` *modifies* the existing list instead of producing a new list with the added element.

#### Exercise
Do you think this will work?

```python
cheeses = ['Gorgonzola', 
           'Emmentaler', 
           'Camembert']
print(cheeses)
```

Surprised? Code inside parentheses, brackets and braces can span several lines, which can sometimes make your code easier to read.

#### Exercise
If you want to test if a value is in a list you use the `in` operator. Try this:

```python
print('Tiramisu' in desserts)
print('Meatloaf' in desserts)
```

#### Exercise
You can concatenate two lists to produce a new joined list. Make sure you figure out how this works before you try it out. Then experiment with changing the lists. Can you concatenate two empty lists?

```python
some_list = [1, 2, 3]
another_list = [7, 8, 9]
merged_list = some_list + another_list
print(merged_list)
```

This is yet another example of how the functionality of Python objects lets them "know" how to behave under different circumstances, such as when adding two objects (see @sec:add_method).

#### Exercise
What do you think is printed here? Make sure you figure out how you think this works before you try it out. What does the `append` method return?

```python
my_list = []
x = my_list.append(7)
print(x)
print(my_list)
```

## Indexing and slicing lists {-}

Now you know how to make lists, but to work with the values in lists you must also know how to access the individual values that a list contains. Fortunately, indexing lists works just like indexing strings: Each value in a list is identified by an *index* exactly like each character in a string:

```python
numbers = [7, 4, 6, 2, 8, 1]
print("first value is", numbers[0])
print("second value is", numbers[1])
print("third value is", numbers[2])
```

Notice that the function `len` can also compute the length of a list. So you also get the last value in list like this:

```python
numbers = [7, 4, 6, 2, 8, 1]
last_index = len(numbers)-1
print("Last element is", numbers[last_index])
```

If you want a sub-list of values from a list (we also call that a *slice*) you specify a start index and an end index separated by a colon, just like with strings:

```python
print(numbers[1:4])
```

When you run that you can see that `numbers[1:4]` is substituted for `[4, 6, 2]`, so the slicing operation produces a new list of the specified values.

#### Exercise
What do these two expressions reduce to?

```python
[11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17][2]
```

#### Exercise
What is printed here? Do all the substitution and reduction steps and compare to the exercise above.

```python
l = [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17] 
print(l[2])
```

#### Exercise
What is printed here? Do *all* the substitution and reduction steps -- and do it *twice*. Next week you will be happy you did.

```python
numbers = [1,2,3]
i = 0
print(number[i])
i = 1
print(number[i])
i = 2
print(number[i])
```

#### Exercise
What do you think happens here? Make up your mind and try out the code below:

```python
l = [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17] 
l[4] = "Donald"
print(l)
```

Were you surprised what happened? Compare to @sec:immutable_strings. Lists are not immutable like strings and you can replace values by assigning a new value to an index in the list.

#### Exercise
With your knowledge of slicing, what do you think is printed below:

```python
l = [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]
print(l[:3])
print(l[3:])
print(l[:])
```

#### Exercise
What do you think happens when you specify an index that does not correspond to a value in the list:

```python
l = [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17] 
print(l[7])
```

Read and understand the error message. Does it ring a bell?

#### Exercise
Do you think you also get an error when you specify a slice where the end is too high? Try it out:

```python
l = [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]
print(l[4:99])
```

I guess that is also worth remembering.

#### Exercise
Which value in a list named `l` does this expression reduce to?

```python
l[len(l)-1]
```

#### Exercise
If you do not like Emmentaler you can just delete it. What do you think the `del` keyword does?

```python
cheeses = ['Gorgonzola', 'Emmentaler', 'Camembert']
print(cheeses)
del cheeses[1]
print(cheeses)
```

#### Exercise
Because intervals are "ends exclusive" we can compute the length of a slice as `end - start`:

```python
l = [7, 4, 6, 2, 8, 1]
start = 1
end = 4
print("{} has length {}".format(l[start:end], end-start))
```

Think about what this code would look like if ends were included in intervals.

#### Exercise
Another advantage of "ends exclusive" intervals is that you only need one index to split a list in two:

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
i = 3
beginning = numbers[:i]
end = numbers[i:]
print(beginning + end)
```

If ends were included in intervals this would not be as simple.

#### Exercise
Do *all* the substitution and reduction steps in your head (or on paper) before you write any of the following code. Think carefully and make up your mind what you think will be printed below. Remember that the *value* of a list is a container that holds other *values* in it. Then write the code and see if you were right. If you were not, make sure you figure out what led you to the wrong conclusion. 

```python
x = 'A'
y = 'B'
z = 'C'
lst = [x, y, z]
print(lst)

x = 'Preben'
print(lst) # what is printed here? 

lst[0] = 'Mogens'
print(lst) # what is printed here?
```

#### Exercise
Do you remember this trick from string slicing?

```python
l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(l[::-1])
```

#### Exercise
You can produce a list by splitting a long string into smaller parts. Think: "*Hey string, split yourself on this smaller string*". Try these variations to figure out how it works

```python
"Homo sapiens neanderthalensis".split(" ")
"Homo sapiens neanderthalensis".split('en')
'ATGCTCGTAACGACACTGCACTACTACAATAG'.split('')
"1, 2, 3, 5, 3, 2, 5, 3".split(', ')
"1,2,3,5,3,2,5,3".split(',')
'ATGCTCGTAACGACACTGCACTACTACAATAG'.split()
"Homo sapiens neanderthalensis".split()
```

Notice that the method has a default behavior when no argument is passed to it.

#### Exercise
You can produce a string by joining the elements of a list (if all the elements are strings of course). Think: "*Hey string, put yourself in between all the strings in this list*".

```python
"-".join(['Homo', 'sapiens', 'neanderthalensis'])
"...".join(['Homo', 'sapiens', 'neanderthalensis'])
"".join(['A', 'T', 'G'])
```

Notice how you can join something on an empty string. This is a very useful technique; for example if you want to turn a list of characters into a string.

## General exercises {-}

What does this expression reduce to? `'aaaaa'`, `'BaBaBa'`, or `'Banan'`. Make up your mind and and then run the expression to check.

```python
'a'.join('Banana'.split('a')[:3] * 4)[-5:]
```
